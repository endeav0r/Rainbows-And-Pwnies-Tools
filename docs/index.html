            <h3 align="center">Finding ROP Gadgets</h3>
            <p>The original goal of rop_tools was to find ROP gadgets, and it has
            remained true to this functionality. It still has a powerful and
            fast ROP gadget finding implementation which works on both 32 and
            64 bit x86 ELF and PE binaries.</p>
            
            <p>rop_tools find three types of rop gadgets, but only two are
            really going to be of use to you. They are ret and jmp [reg]
            gadgets. These are outputed as text for you to grep at will.</p>
            
            <p>rop_tools also finds gadgets of varying "depth". Depth is the
            number of instructions backwards from the ret/jmp that you wish to
            search, and is useful for finding functionality when only a small
            number of gadgets are available. A depth of 1 would include one
            instruction plus the ret/jmp. A depth of 2 would include two
            instructions, and so on.</p>
            
            <p>An example of finding all ret and jmp [ret] gadgets of depth 2 in
            rop_tools would be:</p>
            
            <pre>rop_tools -e rop_tools -rjd 2</pre>

            <h3 align="center">Lua scripting</h3>
            <p>The real power of rop_tools comes from its library of binary 
            analysis tools. They have been broken out into a lua API for you to
            interact with.</p>
            
            <p><strong>A key component of this API centers around the types
            int_t and uint_t.</strong> These are custom types provided by 
            rop_tools, used in both lua and the underlying C library. They allow
            you to interact with 32 and 64 bit binaries through one interface.
            You write the code once, and it just works. These types support all
            the basic artihmetic operations, + - / * %, and comparison, < <= ==.
            You cannot mix int_t and uint_t types in these operations, but you 
            can cast an int_t to a uint_t and a uint_t to a int_t. The inability
            to operate seemlessly between int_t and uint_t is a feature, and
            designed to make sure your code is correct.</p>
            
            <p>Two of the rop_tools lua libraries are currently documented. They
            are the types library encompassing int_t and uint_t, as well as the
            exec_t library, which provides one inteface for working with ELF and
            PE binaries.</p>
            
            <p>lua scripts are launched with the -l flag to the binary, followed
            by the name of the script. Any further arguments on the command line
            will be passed to the binary in a table named argv. Note that lua
            tables begin at index 1 by convention, so the first argument passed
            will be at argv[1].</p>
