I don't have time to write up a more official license, but the spirit is:
  1) Don't post this software publicly. If you share it, share it between on
     an individual basis. IE: You may email this software to another person,
     but not to a mailing/distribution list, nor may you post it online.
  2) If you share this software on an individual basis, you must do so free of
     charge.
  3) Any distributions must retain the above copyright notice, this license, 
     and the disclaimer.
  4) rop_tools is designed to be extended through scripts. You maintain the
     copyright to any scripts your write using rop_tools, and any works created
     with rop_tools. You may, obviously, distribute any works you create as you
     see fit, but they may not be distributed with rop_tools unless on an
     individual basis.
  5) You may reverse-engineer and hack rop_tools as you see fit, but these
     modifications may only be distributed separately from rop_tools, for
     example in a binary patch. You may not modify rop_tools and then
     distribute your modification in a manner which would violate this license,
     such as posting your entire modified binaries publicly.
